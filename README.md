# Sorting-Visualizer-Project
I made this project inspired by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXYym4Wbkc" target="_blank">sorting visualizer tutorial</a> made by <a href="https://github.com/clementmihailescu" target='_blank'>@clementmihailescu</a> on his youtube channel. After watching this video I decided to recreate the project changing some details and adding other sorting methods.
