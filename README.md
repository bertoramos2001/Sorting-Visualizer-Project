# Sorting-Visualizer-Project
I made this project inspired by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXYym4Wbkc" target="_blank">sorting visualizer tutorial</a> made by <a href="https://github.com/clementmihailescu" target='_blank'>@clementmihailescu</a> on his youtube channel. After watching this video I decided to recreate the project by changing some details and adding more sorting methods.

## Link to the project
You can watch the proyect in action by clicking <a href="https://sorting-visualizer-project.netlify.app/" target="_blank">this link</a> (as of now, only bubble sort is working and the css is not finished yet)
